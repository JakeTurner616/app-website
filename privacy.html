	<p>On behalf of serverboi.org, we take your privacy very seriously. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your information.</p>
<h2>Information We Collect</h2>

<h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
<p>We use the images generated by users solely for the purpose of displaying them in the app and improving the service. We do not share, sell, or distribute the images to any third parties.</p>

<h2>How We Protect Your Information</h2>
<p>We take appropriate measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure. We use industry-standard security measures, such as encryption and firewalls, to protect your information.</p>
